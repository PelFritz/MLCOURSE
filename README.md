# Introduction into machine learning
This is a soft introduction into machine learning. However, to do machine learning one needs some programming knowledge. 
Programming itself is quite fun, so fear not. Below are some links to gentle introductions to python programming:

1. For those who understand better with videos here is a good one [Learn Python in One Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8).
2. For those who prefer books here is a recommendation [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).

If you already have some programming knowledge from another language then getting into python is easier. After all the
programming way of thinking cuts across these languages. For example

In R, consider we have a list "mylist" we index the first element with `mylist[[1]]` but in python we do something
slightly different `mylist[0]`. Well because python starts counting from zero, and we index our list like R programmers
index their vectors.
